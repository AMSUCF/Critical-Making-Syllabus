# Making Exercise Four: Hypertext

This week, we're going to consider the possibilities of hypertext, building our skills at making using the "internet vernacular" with an emphasis on interactivity. Though you may have encountered Twine before as a platform for games and storytelling primarily, it is a powerful platform for scholarship more broadly, and this week you can take a narrative-driven or essay-influenced approach to your making. Feel free to incorporate illustrations, gifs, and other elements of materiality drawing on our work thus far.

## The Hypertext Prompt

Drawing on the examples from this week, choose an approach to guide your hypertext design, and think about how you might incorporate "choice" into your scholarship. As you work, consider how you might engage all or some of these key elements we see in other Twine and hypertextual scholarly experiments:

- **Choice and Argument.** Consider how interactive essays might employ elements of choice for emphasis and as part of the scholarly framework. Jim McGrath et al's [*Insufficient Memories*](https://jimmc-grath.itch.io/insufficient-memories) offers an example of this in action as part of an exhibition on memory and materiality. My collaboration [*Blocked In*](http://hyperrhiz.io/hyperrhiz21/games/5-blocked-in.html) is an example of this approach, as is  Caleb Milligan's [*En(Twine)d with Ergodic Rhetoric*](http://cconlinejournal.org/milligan.html) uses the form to reflect on Twine itself.

- **Autoethnography and Reflection** Recalling our discussion of hypertext as personal, Twine offers a compelling space for scholars to engage in autoethnography. Stuart Moulthrop's [*Dread Box*](https://thedigitalreview.com/issue00/dread-box/begin.html) falls into this category, engaging with 2020 through a poetic lens. Dietrich Squinkifer's [*Impostor Syndrome*](https://games.squinky.me/impostor/) reflects on embodiment in text. Similarly, consider Lee Skallerup Bessette's discussions of representing ADHD in Twine from this week's videos, and Cait S. Kirby's more narrative-driven commentary on COVID-19 re-opening plans, [*September 7, 2020*](https://caitkirby.com/downloads/Fall%202020.html).

- **Simulation and Representation** Twine offers the means for building on a dataset or your area of study in a way that invites the reader to share the experience. A few examples of this type of work include Zoe Quinn et al's [*Depression Quest*](http://www.depressionquest.com/) and Carly Kocurek et al's [*Choice: Texas*](http://playchoicetexas.com/). Note that Laura Okkema's approach to activist critical making from our readings is motivated by this type of data-driven representation as well as by autoethnography and reflection, and offers a reminder that many of these elements overlap and intersect in practice.

Your work should be short (playable in less than five minutes) and doesn't need to be procedurally complicated - think about this as an opportunity to prototype or explore the ways interactivity might feature in your approach to making as we go forward.

## The Basic Twine-Making Process

This week, you can choose how to approach building your project depending on your experience with Twine and other web programming. I've provided a starter file that also serves as a tutorial: to get started with that file, follow these steps:

1. **[Download Twine 2.](https://twinery.org/)** Follow the installation directions for your operating system, and make sure the application runs - you'll need administrative permissions and may need to agree to override security settings depending on your system.
2. **[Download the Tutorial.](twineworkshop.html)** Save the file somewhere you can locate it on your computer, and open Twine 2. From the righthand menu, select "Import from file," and navigate to the .html file you downloaded.
3. **Explore the Tutorial.** Load the tutorial in your web browser and follow the steps while referring back to the Twine file to see the original source. Try modifying the file directly to get started, or if you are more experienced with Twine, consider using one of the additional resources noted below. Consider building your first Twine by modifying the tutorial as suggested throughout.

Don't forget to save and test frequently as you work!

## Additional Twine Resources

If you have experience or want to go beyond this initial tutorial, here's a few starting points to consider. This isn't necessary, but might also provide you with ideas for the future.

- **[*Twining* Tutorials](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/ms35tb924).** In *Twining*, we walk through several approaches to Twine in the practical chapters. I would suggest P-4 if you are interested in additional aesthetic elements, and P-2 / P-3 if you are interested in procedural elements and poetics.
- **[The Twine Cookbook](https://twinery.org/cookbook/)** This well-documented project walks through the different Twine story formats and a number of common elements and structures you might attempt to incorporate - this works particularly well for copying and modifying working examples code.
- **[Exemplary Interactive Fiction](https://ifcomp.org/comp/2020)** While I've focused on essays and intentionally scholarly work in my exmaples, there's a lot you can draw on in the approaches of fiction writers. For a starting point, consider exploring the winners of the past Interactive Fiction Competitions.

## Quick Tips

1. Consider hosting your .html file, particularly if you want to include images, GIFs, and other audiovisual components. You can use hosting space you already have, or consider sharing your Twine work on GitHub pages.
2. Remember, don't use the web-based version of Twine 2 unless absolutely necessary, and if you are using it, make sure to save your .html file to your computer regularly! This is not an online hosting service, and you won't be able to access your project from a different browser.
3. While there's lots of options out there for greater procedural complexity, don't worry about learning anything complex for this project! Focus on simple, choice-driven representation and exploring an idea you find compelling.
