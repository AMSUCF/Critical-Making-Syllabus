# Making Exercise Three: Internet Vernacular

This week, we're going to start to play with digital making more directly through working in the shorthand of the internet vernacular: animated GIFs. Recall Jason Scott's epic collection of [under construction](http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/) GIFs, which themselves capture a lost time in the history of the personal web. Now, our association with GIFs is more driven by video fragments as frequently, we rely on others' imagery as a major form of communication - shows and films that are otherwise forgotten live on because of an isolated and well-selected moment. GIFs are thus an excellent starting point for exploring new media composition.

## The Internet Vernacular Prompt

Keeping in mind the introductory provocations in *Your Computer is On Fire*, we'll be playing with the internet vernacular modeled in *Buzzademia* as a way to think through our relationship with making in public, and making for the web more broadly. As you work, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- **Explore Rapid Prototyping.** Make at least five shareable GIFs to include in your post, but consider making a lot more along the way. This is a "fast" form for internet communication - most of the work goes into shaping your source material, and having ideas on what to make. Try iterating and refining to make the most of this low-investment form.

- **Place your GIFs in Conversation** In your reflection, share the framing of the work, paricularly in terms of other GIFs and memes that haped it. Thinking through your GIF as part of the web can also be a method for exploring and communicating your relationship with it as a technology as we play with two fundamental procedural elements: loops and timelines.

- **Focus on Aesthetic Impact.** Just like with every skill we're experimenting with, there's a lot to learn when taking video or arranging still photos. Play with your camera orientation; closeness to the object; framing; and choice of subject. Think about how you will be isolating the moment: you don't need more than a few seconds of video for an effective loop.

## The GIF-Making Process - Video

Several of your GIFs should start as video clips. However, instead of working directly from commercial media in the referential manner of most reaction GIFs, I want you to explore the making components of GIFs through first exploring physical materiality and movement, then digitizing and fragmenting the results. This offers us a way to transition from the visual and material play we've done in week one and week two over to the digital, and this type of media-making will be useful again and again as a way to add aesthetic engagement to your experiments.

First, you'll need to take some videos. Your phone camera or laptop's built-in webcam are all you need - there's no expectation of dedicated equipment, and resolution isn't particularly important for  If you're comfortable in front of the camera, you might try starring, as Casey Fiesler does in her [TikToks](https://www.tiktok.com/@professorcasey?lang=en). If you're less thrilled about that, consider objects, pets, places, and moments (the passing of a storm, perhaps) that strike you. I'll be working from my cat video for this tutorial - a throwback to her kitten days.

The most flexible way to make GIFs is with Adobe Photoshop, which is available on campus in the labs: however, since lab access is more challenging currently, I'm going to focus on free tools throughout the course. If you have Photoshop, try [this tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/make-animated-gif.html) for options working from both video and images. But don't worry: you can complete all the assignments without commercial software.

We'll be using [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) as our primary free alternative this week. It's not as aesthetically flexible, but it's a fast way to go from your video fragments to the styling of the internet vernacular, with options for meme styling, text design, and filtering. (You're welcome to use another tool as well!) You'll need an account, but you can set any content you create to private and download it directly to post to the discussion.

The Giphy editing process consists of two stages: first, crop your clip down to an appropriate moment for a loop. Loops are a fundamental structure of the web - recall their importance to classic Flash animations - and one we'll encounter again in the context of programming. Loops reduce the amount of data required to provide content, and allow GIFs to function as shorthand - recall the essay examples, which employ them repeatedly.

As you work, consider the options, and what they reflect about the internet vernacular and its assumptions. Think about your process, and how you would expect your GIF to be received in isolation from its original context of filming. Make three different GIFs this way - try to make them as distinct from one another as possible.

## The GIF-Making Process - Still Images

For our second stage of GIF-making, we'll keep the same ideas in mind, but work from still images. You can craft your images however you want: you might take photos of elements arranged using material objects (fabric, paper shapes, clay, LEGO figures) and use them to craft a stop-motion animation, or you can use a free image-editing program to craft something expressive through digital drawing. For this purpose, I particularly recommend [PixilArt](https://www.pixilart.com/) as it limits the scale and lends itself to retro work.

Once you've created your images and thought about how they will flow (or clash) in sequence, it's time to add them to a timeline. The timeline is our next fundamental procedural element: it's the heart of Flash, which as you'll recall was one of the early platforms that shaped making and experimentation on the web. The timeline takes the ordering we explored last week spatially, through comics, and makes it a sequence the computer can process. We'll use Giphy again, but this time upload the first frame of your image. It will take you to a slideshow view where you can add more images, reorder them, and change the time of display.

My final outcome here needs a lot of work - and I should have edited the photos for compositional consistency in advance! However, I like recapturing some of the influence of the gltich on the original selfie, and it serves as a quick documentation of a process that is otherwise invisible.

## Quick Tips

1. Consider reducing the resolution on your source files before you work with GIPHY. Large files, or images with different orientation / resolution, will potentially complicate your formatting.

2. You don't need to use the embed codes or set your images to public: after you've created the GIF, just right click to download, and rename from the default of "giphy" to distinguish your different files.

3. The better your source material (in composition, thoughtfulness, timing, etc.), the more compelling your final output will be. Since the process of making this week is relatively fast, consider trying lots of different experiments and sharing your favorites - even if the process worked out better than the product!
