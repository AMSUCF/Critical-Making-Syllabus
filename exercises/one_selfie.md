# Making Exercise One: Selfie

This week, we'll be doing a warm-up exercise: this will serve both as an opportunity to introduce yourself as someone who makes things, and as a way to practice the process of documenting and reflecting on what you make throughout this course.

Every week, you should plan on first completing the readings and watching the recorded material before diving in to the tutorials. These will provide the framework for the making, as well as examples of what that making might look like. This week, the tutorial will not focus on a specific platform or approach but instead will focus on the process of documentation through a sample project.

## The Selfie Prompt

Typically, each week's making exercise will start with a prompt to guide your making: this will be a set of constraints to go along with the methods introduced in the week's materials. This week, you'll be producing a crafted "selfie" that captures your current relationship with making, ideally in a way that allows you to explore the connections with your scholarship through the lenses introduced in this week's introductions. As you make this selfie, keep these recommended constraints in mind:

- **Aim for approximately three hours of making.** This is the same constraint I used for my demo below, and in general it's a good guideline for managing your time in this course. This may force you to take shortcuts, leave out features, and end up with something incomplete and unpolished - and that's intentional! Setting reasonable expectations for what you can accomplish each week is essential: think of this class as a sampler menu that will introduce lots of methods you can explore more in the future.
- **Use materials you have on hand.** For this week, I encourage you to craft your "selfie" using materials and knowledge you already have. Think broadly about what that might look like: anything, from a [Lego mosaic](https://www.brothers-brick.com/2020/07/01/lego-art-revealed-as-mosaics-of-the-beatles-marilyn-monroe-star-wars-sith-and-iron-man-news/) to [macaroni art](https://www.boothbayregister.com/article/memory-bench-proposed-boothbay-harbor-artist/9953) to a virtual 3D model is on the table. You can even take ideas from [Shaheer Zazai's Word play](https://www.cbc.ca/arts/how-to-weave-an-afghan-rug-using-microsoft-word-1.4612765) and use your digital or physical material unexpectedly.
- **Embrace failure and mistakes.** Work to resist the urge to go back, redo, and extend your time beyond these suggested guidelines: this is an ephemeral exercise intended to help us get in the mindset for critical making. Remember to focus on documenting your process and moving forward, and don't get bogged down in the details. Remember, we will continually be bringing back the emphasis to the process, not the object.

Your reflection for this prompt should consist of approximately five images documenting your process from concept to final work, with a short narrative accompanying it that walks through your thinking. Make connections to the readings and anything that inspired your work, including both examples from the course materials and your own experience with craft outside of this course.

## My Selfie Sample

*This is provided as an example - it need not be precisely imitated by any means, but I hope it makes concrete what might otherwise seem abstract!*

This week, I took the same prompt as I've given you here, and took it as a challenge to experiment with my own approach to what I'll refer to broadly as [computational craft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwtKiwQxyKY), or play at the intersection of more traditional craft (in my case, textiles and quilts) and procedural methods. With the short window for this exercise, I knew I didn't have time to both build something generative and make a material object, so I decided to focus on the process of playing with the textiles more than on the procedural side of the "selfie." This is in part a nod to Matt Ratto's observations in this week's readings regarding the "role of investment in connecting lived experience to critical perspectives" (258) - that is, the "time I have wasted" in textiles informs my critical perspectives on texts and technology.

Given that, I set out with a basic plan for my making: first, I would find a way to filter or algorithmically manipulate an image of myself into something that sparked a visual interest or connection. Then, I would rapidly prototype that manipulated image using simple quilting methods. I considered loading up Photoshop, but knew that would likely put me on a path of perfectionism with my search for a meaningful way to manipulate my image: instead, I searched for Android apps with decent ratings for photo manipulation, and ended up downloading one called "Glitch Lab."

There's a lot of options in this that I knew would lead me down a path of tiny pieces and excessive time for this exercise, so I explored the pre-built filters until I found one that offered a distortion that offered a retro feeling that reminded me of the algorithmic distortions of glitch art broadly.

However, I realized as I moved to the next step that I'd set myself a challenge of materiality: the vibrant colors of the unnatural, processed image were poorly matched by my collection of quilting cottons. But rather than backtrack, I decided to embrace the muted palette and acknowledge that the transformation from tech to textile is perhaps appropriately a type of "softening."

Some of these fabrics date back to the 90s: I've been working with textile in one way or another for a long time. My fabric collection is its own archive reflecting back phases of my work in ways that are themselves layered with memory - for instance, one of the purples I pulled is a remnant from a baby quilt patterned off Eric Carle's illustrations. Playing with intertext(ile)uality is inherent in quilting, and something I like to bring to critical making in any medium.

Once I settled on fabric, the next step was cutting. I could achive something more exacting through digital tools - taking that photo manipulation into photoshop, using it as a cutting pattern, and allowing the machine to cut with precision. However, the labor in that would far exceed the time allowed for experimentation, so instead I went with a hasty sketch to guide free-hand cutting of applique shapes. (For the textile-y, I used double-sided fusible interfacing so that I could place the shapes quickly and not worry about carefully sewing everything on.)

I've never quilted a selfie before, and I've been wary of trying to do anything human-looking because the precision is so demanding. But for this, I wanted to play with impressions. Once everything was ironed down, I moved to the sewing machine to add the "quilting"--the lines that hold everything together. For speed, I stuck with a single color of embroidery thread, and thought about using linework to capture impressions (ok, and maybe wrinkles.)

The end result is something not particularly human (the vote in my group chat was "remotely human"), but in the process of blending the procedural artist input of the app's glitched lens with the fiber materiality I see the potential for exploring how we negotiate the tech-text-textile. I could imagine revisiting this as part of thinking through feminist lenses on manipulated photography, which is frequently associated with vanity and performance of artifice. The outcome is perhaps more than a little unrecognizable, but the process is one I would revisit.
