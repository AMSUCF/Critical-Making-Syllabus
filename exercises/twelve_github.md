# Exercise Twelve: GitHub

You might have noticed that this entire course is housed in part on Github Pages: this service provides the easiest option for free hosting that also makes it simple to share works with the code easily visible, which can be particularly helpful for teaching or for your own portfolio when on the job market. For the last required exercise this semester, you'll be taking everything you've done, curating it, and pulling it together on a page that speaks to the skills you've developed and the themes your work has explored.

## The GitHub Prompt

Many of you have used GitHub pages previously in Intro. This exercise will be similar: we'll use GitHub Pages and [Markdown](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown). You can prepare your files in any editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can include images in your main page by using relative links prefaced with an exclamation mark as in this page's source code, which you can view in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMSUCF/Critical-Making-Syllabus). Then, reference the video and the steps on the [GitHub Pages tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) to choose a theme and launch your page.

- **Theory / Artistic Context** - Provide a brief introduction setting the stage for the work, with references to any recommend readings (these should both draw on this course and on any other influences from your own work.) Remember our focus is on process and inquiry, not just the demonstration of technical skills: the theoretical framework should demonstrate the "critical" part of your approach to making.

- **Curated Examples** - Select at least five exercises you are pleased with, or that you feel fit well together to show the direction of your work. Focus on preparing each according to the needs of the content: for a Twine file, make sure to publish to .html and include any linked images in your folder. For a Bitsy project, make sure to download the complete game as a .html file. For P5.js, make sure to unzip the download and include all files in the original package. For other projects that are currently static images, consider making a Markdown or .html page to highlight the work.

- **Working Landing Page** - Make sure every example is uploaded to GitHub, functional, and linked from your main landing page, as in the materials for this course. Your critical making landing page might be a subset of your original website, or you could treat this project as its own new repository. Keep in mind the advice we've had from our guest speakers regarding the importance of this page.

While the focus here is not on making new work, this could be a good time to finish or polish any work that you particularly want to include that might have elements you didn't have time to originally complete. Think about this as an opportunity to pull everything together for a potential audience outside this course.
