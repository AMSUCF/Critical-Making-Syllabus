# Making Exercise Two: Comic

Last week, we warmed up for the semester with an exploration of how we might already act as makers, and looked for connections between creative work and our interests as scholars. This week, we're going to think about the limitations of text as a means of scholarly communication by exploring the intersection of image and text--imagetext, or comics. Like our first exercise, this is intended to offer space for playing with materiality and visual intention: we're not worrying about the digital yet, although digital methods and tools might play a role in what you decide to create.

## The Mini-Comic Prompt

This exercise is influenced by a prompt from Nick Sousanis, and draws on his [Making Comics](https://spinweaveandcut.com/making-comics-s2021/) course, which you can explore fully in his online documentation. You can find a substantial collection of resources and inspiration for this particular exercise, the [Mini-Comic, in his course](http://spinweaveandcut.com/making-tools-and-minicomics/). For this week, keep the following constraints in mind:

- **Unify form and intention.** Note how the comics we've looked at build an argument, commentary, or critique through the juxtaposition of the visual and the textual. For this week, start to think about your communicative intention: will the comic you make cirtique an object relevant to your research? Connect with a frustration you have about textual scholarship or its usual assumptions? This form lends itself to commentary that might include the remixing of creative commons or public domain materials as well as influences from the punk aesthetic and Xeroxed materiality of zines.
- **Focus on visual exploration, not stressing over your drawing ability.** If you prefer to work with "found" images (ideally ones licensed for such use), that's fine for this particular piece. However, this is an opportunity to draw upon any visual creative experience you have, and consider through your own practice how Nick Sousanis frames the visual as a lens for exploring thoughts and expanding metaphors for scholarly thinking and criticism.
- **Keep it short.** As with last week, aim to spend about three hours making your mini-comic. This doesn't leave much time for indecision, editing, or re-dos, so stick with your impulses and embrace the experiment. The goal is not perfection, but exploration. Scale your ambition for this project to a single concept, idea, or influence rather than taking on a large argument.

As before, your reflection for this prompt should consist of approximately five images documenting your process from concept to final work, with a short narrative accompanying it that walks through your thinking. Make connections to the readings and anything that inspired your work, including both examples from the course materials and your own experience with comics outside of this course.

## The Mini-Comic Process

As we move into digital tools, these process guidelines will get more and more complex, offering guidance for building a starter project or seed for your work. Since this week's process is more fluid and material-driven, the process guidelines are intended to help you find a manageable scope and approach. Feel free to ignore suggestions that don't work for your vision this week, and to draw in influences from your broader work: to quote one of the [guides](https://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/all_about_comics/all_about/77/) on making mini-comics, the answer to "How Do I Make Mini-Comics?" is "any way you want." However, these steps will help you get moving.

- **1. Select your format.** If you're feeling stuck on materiality, here's a [simple blueprint for a folded mini-comic](https://dw-wp.com/2010/06/a-simple-minicomic-format/) to get you started. This is a basic way to use the page and keep your scale manageable. However, you can also look at work that uses more experimental formats for ideas, like this [collection of comic editions](https://www.editionsrutabaga.com/les-livres) and Andy Poyiadgi's [origami comic](http://www.ajpoyiadgi.com/comics#/origami-comic/).
- **2. Focus on an argument.** Using the work we viewed from Nick Sousanis, Scott McCloud, and Jason Helms, think about an idea or argument that you've found difficult to communicate in text. It doesn't have to be an idea easily expressed as an academic thesis: it might be a frustration with a limitation; an expansion of a definition; or a commentary on a framework. Let that argument guide your image-text, and think about how the visuals you create, copy, find, or remix work in relationship with the text.
- **3. Play with the visual.** The visual component of this assigment is our emphasis: we'll be letting this type of experiment guide us into making images a larger part of our work going forward. Consider trying several approaches throughout your mini-comic: for instance, you might [try blended materiality](http://neillcameron.blogspot.com/2015/07/instacomics-everyone.html) for one section; use a [digital comics app](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/technology/personaltech/create-your-own-digital-comics-whether-you-can-draw-or-not.html) for creating a strip; and try [stick-figure comics](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/art-therapy-draw-a-stick-figure-comic--cms-29760) for another.

It's OK to be inconistent in your style: in your reflection, discuss what you were thinking and what choices you were making as you worked. For example, here's an illustration from a comic element of my "Alice in Dataland" experiment that started as a retracing of a Tenniel illustration recast through a digital lens.

I used this approach for the cheesy, cartoony illustrations for a full section of that *Kairos* article, [viewable here](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.1/inventio/salter/five/index.html).

This type of remix, tracing-to-create, and play is welcome. Remember, we're cultivating here an approach to the material that we'll bring into the digital as we progress this semester! As with the other approaches we'll be trying, know that some of the students in this course have much more experience with visual creativity than others, so try to focus on your own work and process rather than comparing yourself to others.
