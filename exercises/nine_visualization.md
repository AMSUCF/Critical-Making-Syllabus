# Making Exercise Nine: Visualization

This week, we'll be taking our first steps with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), a library that allows for visualization, animation, and interaction on the web. (Note the change from the original listing: to reduce some of the procedural complexity and syntax challenges, we'll be using this library twice and iterating on our work - so don't worry if you are doing very, very basic things this week, you'll get to go a bit further later!) The goal is to understand the act of data visualization through playing with how we visualize data - first with P5, and then with any materiality of your choice.

## The Visualization Prompt

This week's exercise serves two goals: we'll begin exploring the act of visualization, and expanding your procedural vocabulary and comfort with creative coding. This can be a slower process than some of our other types of making, but the tools you gain can be incorporated into our other platforms for multimodal work and experimentation. To allow for both this procedural growth and a meaningful reflection on visualization, you will be creating two ways: first with P5.js, and then in any visualization modality you would like to try (inspired by the work in [Kairos](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/25.1/), but not limited to it!)

- **Change and play with the provided P5 structures.** Take screenshots or share links to your forked versions of the provided samples, noting how the limitations and structures of each design influenced what you chose to visualize. You can work from "real" or "conceptual" data here, as discussed in this week's live session and videos.

- **Conceptualize a larger visualization concept.** Drawing on the expressive examples in the reading and your own work thus far, consider something in your work that would be well-served by visualization. In your reflection, note the challenges this visualization might present, considering particularly your audience and how you might approach this communication as a designer informed by the principles in our readings.

- **Explore a preliminary visualization of your concept.** You can work in any materiality or format that makes sense for the visualization, from textile to comic and beyond. Document your visualization through photos, screenshots, or sharing the interactive work as appropriate to the form. It's ok for this visualization to be rough or to use speculative data at this stage.

As with our other exercises, make sure to include both a link to any digital elements as well as documentation of the process. For the experimental or material visualization, this might include sketches or iterations of your design.

## Walkthrough and Resources

In addition to the provided P5 materials, you might find it helpful to explore examples of data visualization broadly. Here are a few sources to start with:
