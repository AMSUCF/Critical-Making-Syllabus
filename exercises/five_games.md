# Making Exercise Five: Games

This week, we'll be taking our first steps with Bitsy, the tool you'll be using to develop your essay game. Bitsy is a surprising combination of simple and powerful: it embodies the playful practices of "creativity under constraints" we've started exploring through these time-limited, occasionally Dada-ist exercises this semester. At times you might find its limitations frustrating, but these constraints can also help you stick to the available time and keep your scope manageable.

## The Game Prompt

For this exercise, keep in mind Noah Wardrip-Fruin's challenge in this week's readings to academics: Bitsy has a limited set of operational logics for you to employ, so does it allow you to make a game about something? Keep these elements in mind as you work, while building on the procedural thinking we started with Twine:

- **Craft a meaningful environment.** As you work on this part of the project, remember to think about how you will operate within the constraints of a limited color palette and pixel grid. You'll by necessity need to scale back your thinking and focus on the essentials - consider how your colors will shape the mood; how choices in details will differentiate one character or object from another; and how your world will fit together as the player moves from "room" to "room." You might find [pixsy](https://ruin.itch.io/pixsy), a conversion tool for making rooms from photos, helpful in crafting evocative spaces.

- **Use dialog to share your argument.** As you think about "dialog," remember that this can be text that is reflective, poetic, or internal - it doesn't have to mean conversations with other characters in the traditional sense. Think about our conversation on platforms when scoping the pace and length of your dialogue segments, and consider that you can also draw inspiration from other hypertextual essays, small-scale games, comics, and the work of the "internet vernacular."

- **Build for interaction.** Think about the "collision" as a mechanism for revealing and understanding the environment, and use the range of sprites, tiles, and items to make the most of interactivity as a way of working through an argument. Take time to explore the essay examples and other works from our readings, and consider how they ask you to engage as a reader-player with the argument.

As always, your post should include both the playable work and the reflection, and consider embedding screenshots (or gifs, and noted below) of your process towards the final.

## Working with Bitsy

You'll notice that Bitsy particularly resonates with some of the more current examples in our discussions and readings, despite its throwback - retro pixel art aesthetics. Also importantly for our purposes given the change to our course modality, the [editor for Bitsy](http://bitsy.org) is online and free.  Below is a screenshot of what you will be seeing as you get started: particularly note the "download" tools. Whenever you are using an online editor, you will want to immediately get in the habit of downloading the game as a .html file regularly to save your work. You can then import to continue.

The first tutorial (which covers similar material as my video included in our module) I recommend referencing is [available here](https://www.shimmerwitch.space/bitsyTutorial.html), and includes a number of links to samples and ways to go forward. However, don't get overwhelmed by all the options linked at the end - the most important rule to keep in mind when working with Bitsy is "think small." As bee ulrich describes in [their article](https://medium.com/@cavegift/https-medium-com-cavegift-bitsy-is-a-tiny-toolset-4016814c5367) on the platform:

> *Where Odyssey feels like a tome, Bitsy games are poems. They’re handcrafted spaces with so little headroom that every last pixel is placed with purpose. Some do it so well they trick you into thinking you’re wandering a 3D dungeon, or cycling a radio through all the bad stations, or flipping through an informative textbook on moths.*

For insights into the process of working with Bitsy towards scholarly output, read [Pippin Barr's account of building an "Ancient Greek Punishment" game in Bitsy](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/bits-and-pieces-of-suffering-creating-ancient-greek-punishments-in-bitsy). This includes a breakdown of aesthetic challenges and opportunities, as well as sample code that will help you work on your own project.

If you want to go further with a particular element of Bitsy, consider using this [tutorial video series](https://videlais.com/bitsy-tutorials/), which cover animation and conditional dialog in more detail than our tutorial.

## Tips and Tricks

- For your process post, consider using the "Record Gif" tool in the interface to share elements you are particularly proud of, or to record iterations of your work as you move through your design process. This is a great way to capture the early stages of your game!

- If you have more experience and are feeling limited by Bitsy, you can take a look at [Borksy](https://ayolland.itch.io/borksy) to expand your options. This is a set of "hacks," or prewritten scripts not unlike the ones we used for macros in Twine. Some of the options you might find particularly useful include dialog choices, a mult-sprite avatar, and character portraits.

- Consider [hosting your work on itch.io.](https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5) This is a great solution for making it easily shareable and playable by others, both in the class and outside of it - if you do post your essay, consider sharing it on Twitter, and tag me if you'd like me to amplify it to others exploring critical making.
