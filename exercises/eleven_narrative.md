# Making Exercise Eleven: Narrative

As we continue our play with P5.js, I've built a starter project for you to explore epoetry and narrative. Depending on your programming background, feel free to branch out further from the provided frameworks. Keep in mind the inspiration works we discussed, and particularly draw on influences such as [Algorithmic Sea](https://the-color-of-water.github.io/AlgorithmicSea-ObservableArti) and [Strange Rain](https://erikloyer.com/index.php/projects/detail/strange_rain), shown below.

Think of this as a free-form creative exercise. You can focus on aesthetics, poetics, or motion, depending on your interests.

## The Narrative Prompt

As we'll be taking our inspiration from electronic poetry and narratives as a form of making this week, this is a free-form exercise in building your P5.js knowledge while exploring computational creativity. Work between existing code and  I've provided three starters that suggest different possibilities for working with P5.js to allow for moving or interactive text. After watching the video, explore their capabilities, and then think about making your own. There are suggestions in each for ways to push the style, text, and design further. Focus on:

- **Experiment with code and debugging.** Try things, and break it. Consider loading in images, exploring , and think about how you can work from basic shapes and text to leave an impression. Remember, if you break things you can always go back and fork the original code.
  
- **Change aesthetics and poetics.** Play with the text, and think about how you can use text and color to convey emotion. Try building a mood, and consider branching out to draw in images or create a sense of space. We'll cover options for play in the live session, and the comments in the samples give suggestions of simple substitutions to try.

- **Generate your own moving or interactive text.** Using generative AI and building on our efforts last week, craft a new prototype with moving or interactive text. Think about the examples provided, and try to use precise prompting and edit the resulting code to achieve your goals.

As always, include links and screenshots of your forked experiments and the new prototype, including the conversation with generative AI.

## Walkthrough and Resources

The three samples provided demonstrate different approaches: try each one to understand the possibilities before you start generating your own.

- [Click Poetry](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1325975) builds on our last mouse interaction piece: click to place a line of text. The work will cycle through a text in order, allowing for a sense of narrative progression or poetry if you write your lines intentionally. The text gradually fades from the screen.
- [Falling Text](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1325914) uses a simple particle system to create moving text, inspired by *Strange Rain.* Don't worry about changing the code for the particle system itself: you can manipulate the speeds, positions, colors, and text to transform the experience.
- [Moving Click Text](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1325979) combines elements of the other two examples to create moving text where the user clicks. The lines will become unreadable as they shift across the screen and fade. Again, don't worry about changing the code for the particle system itself.
